    <h2>403 Errors</h2>
    <p>An HTTP 403 response code means that a client is forbidden from accessing a valid URL. The server understands the request, but it can't fulfill the request because of client-side issues. The caller isn't authorized to access an API that's using an API Gateway Lambda authorizer.</p>
    <h2>Mobile Responsive</h2>
    <p>Mobile-responsive â€“ Websites that are mobile-responsive are pages that have been reformatted to reproduce what you experience on the desktop. This means that instead of shrinking everything down, clickable items are enlarged, and pictures are resized and reformatted.</p>
    <h2>UI/UX of Website</h2>
    <p>UI/UX design aims to create a positive user experience that encourages customers to stick with a brand or product. While a UX Designer decides how the user interface works, the UI designer decides how the user interface looks.</p>
    <h2>Alternate Tags</h2>
    <p>Alt tags provide context to what an image is displaying, informing search engine crawlers and allowing them to index an image correctly. However, not only do alt tags help search engine crawlers, not setting alt tags for your images can have a detrimental effect on the ranking of your web pages.</p>
    <h2>Internal Linking</h2>
    <p>An internal link is any link from one page on your website to another page on your website. Both your users and search engines use links to find content on your website. Your users use links to navigate through your site and to find the content they want to find. Search engines also use links to navigate your site.</p>
